## Sidecars 

In Kubernetes, a pod is a group of one or more containers with shared storage and network. A sidecar is a **utility container** in a pod thatâ€™s loosely coupled to the main application container.

Perhaps the most well known use case of sidecars is proxies in a service mesh architecture, but there are other examples, including log shippers, monitoring agents or data loaders.
