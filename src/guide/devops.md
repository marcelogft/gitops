# GitOps vs DevOps

There is a lot of confusion between DevOps and GitOps

DevOps is a set of software development practices that combine softwware development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the system development life cycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently in close alignment with business objectives.

The benefits of DevOps include: 

* Better collaboration between development and operations
  
* Improved product quality
  
* More frequent releases
  
* Reduced time to market for new features
  
* Decreased costs of design, development, and operation

GitOps aims to create a Continuous Deployment approach to help teams manage clustered or cloud-native applications, all while borrowing concepts from CI/CD and DevOps.

GitOps is a DevOps deployment process that uses Git as the system of record to manage deployment in complex systems. Traditional Ops requires a separate team for deployment, and a new version can take days (if not weeks) to be deployed. DevOps enables engineers to deploy a new version as soon as the code is commplete without waiting for a centralized operations team.

One of the most prominent paradigms to emerge from the DevOps movement is the model of declarative systems and configuration. Simply put, with declarative models, you
describe what you want to achieve as opposed to how to get there. By contrast, in an imperative model, you describe a sequence of instructions for manipulating the system 
to reach your desired state.
